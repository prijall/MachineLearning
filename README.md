# This Repository will contain all my machine learning work!!!

# Day 1

Today, I continued learning Machine learning Algorithms. I learned about Naive Baye's algorith which is used to solve classification problems having many 
independent features.

# Day 2
Revised the concept of Simple Linear Regression through practical implementation with the help of Krish Naik's video. It was littele bit hard for me to grasp the concept of everything as I am a beginner but hope to keep learning and improving.
